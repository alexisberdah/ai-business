## Day 2-3: First Content Push

### Twitter Content (2h total)

**Day 2 - Announcement Thread** (30 min):
```
🚀 I'm building in public: Claude SaaS Starter

The problem: Every Next.js boilerplate is OpenAI-first. Claude Sonnet 4.5 has better streaming, but no one builds for it.

So I'm building the first Claude-optimized SaaS starter.

Here's the 14-day journey to launch 🧵👇

[Thread continues: 8-10 tweets]
1. What I'm building (Claude SaaS Starter)
2. Why Claude > OpenAI for SaaS (streaming, tool use)
3. Tech stack (Next.js 14, Supabase, Stripe)
4. What's included (auth, billing, admin, docs)
5. Launch date (14 days - Day 15)
6. Transparent pricing ($149)
7. Progress tracker (daily updates)
8. Call to action (follow for updates + launch day)
```

**Day 3 - Tech Stack Deep Dive** (30 min):
```
Why I chose this exact tech stack for Claude SaaS Starter:

Next.js 14 (App Router) ✅
Supabase (Auth + DB) ✅
Claude Sonnet 4.5 ✅
Stripe ✅
Tailwind + shadcn/ui ✅

Each decision has a reason. Let me break it down 🧵

[Thread continues: 6-8 tweets explaining each choice]
```

**Engagement routine** (20 min/day):
- [ ] Répondre aux comments sur tes posts
- [ ] Commenter 5-10 posts de makers (add value, pas spam)
- [ ] Retweet 2-3 posts pertinents (with commentary)

---

## Day 4-7: Build Momentum

### Daily Content (1h/day)

**Day 4 - Problem/Solution**:
```
The boilerplate market is broken.

$39 kits: Barebones, outdated docs
$299 kits: Feature bloat, complex setup

I'm building the middle path: $149, core features, world-class docs.

Here's what "actually documented" means 🧵
```

**Day 5 - Claude Streaming Demo**:
```
This is why Claude Sonnet 4.5 is perfect for SaaS:

[GIF: Chat interface with streaming response]

<200ms time-to-first-token
Edge runtime (global latency)
Server-Sent Events (simple, reliable)

OpenAI boilerplates can't match this. Here's how I built it 🧵
```

**Day 6 - Transparent Pricing**:
```
Pricing a boilerplate is hard.

Too cheap: "Is this quality?"
Too expensive: "I'll build it myself"

I chose $149. Here's the math:

- 30h saved × $100/h = $3,000 value
- $149 = 95% discount
- Stripe alone takes 10h to implement correctly

Thread on pricing psychology 🧵
```

**Day 7 - Progress Update**:
```
Week 1 of building Claude SaaS Starter ✅

✅ Auth (email + OAuth)
✅ Claude streaming
✅ Stripe billing
✅ Admin dashboard
✅ Usage metering
✅ Docs (300+ pages)

6 days until launch.

Tomorrow: Product Hunt prep + hunter recruitment 🚀
```
