## I launched my $149 Next.js boilerplate to zero sales. Here's what went wrong.

Two weeks ago I shipped Claude SaaS Starter — a Next.js 16 boilerplate built for Claude (Anthropic's AI). Supabase Auth, Stripe billing, streaming API, admin dashboard, 40 tests, 1,300 lines of docs.

I was proud of the build. Then I launched.

**Here's what happened:**

| Channel | Result |
|---------|--------|
| Reddit r/SideProject | Low engagement |
| Reddit r/ClaudeAI | Post removed (Rule 7: "must be free to try") |
| Reddit r/nextjs | Post removed (Rule 2: "no shilling") |
| Show HN | 1 point, 0 comments |
| Dev.to article | 0 reactions, 0 comments |
| Twitter | 0 followers, no reach |

**Total sales: 0.**

### What I did wrong

**1. Zero presence anywhere.** I created accounts on Reddit, HN, Twitter, and Dev.to the same week I launched. Fresh accounts with no history posting product links = spam. Every community sees through this instantly.

**2. I linked to a sales page, not to value.** My Show HN linked to Gumroad. HN wants to see code, not a checkout page. Reddit wants free tools, not paid products. I was asking people to trust a stranger with $149.

**3. I launched sequentially, not coordinated.** One post per day across 5 days. Each post died alone with no momentum. By the time I posted on r/nextjs, the Show HN was already dead.

**4. My Dev.to article was self-sabotage.** I wrote a detailed technical tutorial that gives away the entire streaming implementation for free, then asked for $149 at the end. It reads like a bait-and-switch.

### What I'm doing differently

Instead of trying to launch again with better copy, I'm stepping back:

- **Listing on boilerplate directories** (boilerplatelist.com, buildkits.dev, etc.) — passive traffic from people actively looking for boilerplates
- **Enabling Gumroad affiliates** — let other devs sell for me for 30% commission
- **Writing SEO content** — Medium articles targeting "Claude API streaming" and comparison keywords
- **Actually participating in communities** before posting about my product

### The product

Still the same, still $149: [Claude SaaS Starter](https://bydaewon.gumroad.com/l/claude-saas-starter)

Next.js 16, Supabase Auth (email + OAuth), Claude streaming on Edge Runtime, Stripe subscriptions, admin dashboard, usage metering, 40 tests, 4 setup guides.

I'm not changing the product. The build is solid. The marketing was the problem.

### Question for IH

For those who've sold developer tools with zero audience: what actually worked for your first 5 sales? I'm curious what tipped the scale.
