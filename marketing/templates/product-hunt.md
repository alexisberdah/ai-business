### First Comment (Maker Introduction)

Post this immediately after launch:

```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm [Your Name], indie maker building AI-powered products.

**Why I built this:**

I was frustrated. Every SaaS boilerplate is OpenAI-first. Claude Sonnet 4.5 has better streaming, longer context, and superior tool use — but zero dedicated tooling.

So I built the first Claude-optimized starter kit.

**What makes it different:**

🔥 **Claude-First**: Streaming optimized for Claude Sonnet 4.5 (<200ms time-to-first-token)
📖 **Docs Quality**: 300+ pages. Zero assumptions. Step-by-step guides.
⚡ **Production-Ready**: Auth + billing + admin + usage tracking. Deploy in 2-4 hours.
💎 **Mid-Tier Pricing**: $149 (premium quality, indie budget)

**What's included:**

✅ Next.js 14 (App Router) + TypeScript
✅ Supabase (Auth + Database + OAuth)
✅ Claude Sonnet 4.5 (real-time streaming)
✅ Stripe (subscription management + webhooks)
✅ Admin dashboard (user management + analytics)
✅ Usage metering (token tracking + cost estimation)
✅ Complete documentation (README, SETUP, STRIPE, OAUTH guides)
✅ 40 passing tests (production confidence)

**Who it's for:**

- Developers launching AI SaaS products
- Founders who want to ship fast
- Teams building Claude-powered apps

**Launch special:**

Early bird: $119 (20% off, code LAUNCH20)
Regular: $149
Yearly: $1,490

First 50 buyers get the discount.

**Transparent journey:**

I'm building in public. I'll share real revenue, conversion rates, and customer feedback publicly.

Current metrics:
- Revenue: $0 (launching now!)
- Twitter followers: [X]
- Goal: $1.5K first month (10 sales)

**Questions I'm happy to answer:**

- Tech stack decisions (why Next.js, why Supabase, why Claude)
- Pricing rationale (how I calculated $149)
- Documentation approach (300+ pages, how/why)
- Build-in-public learnings

**How to try it:**

👉 [Gumroad link]
👉 [GitHub repo] (public, see code quality)

Thank you for checking it out! Your feedback = gold 🙏

## Launch Timing

### Optimal Launch Time
```
12:01am PST (Pacific Standard Time)
```

**Why**:

- First hour = critical for ranking
- Early upvotes = momentum boost

**Convert to your timezone**:
- Paris (CET): 9:01am
- Seoul (KST): 5:01pm
- NYC (EST): 3:01am

**Set multiple alarms**: Don't miss it!

---

## Hunter Strategy

### Option 1: Get Hunted (Recommended)

**Why better than self-hunt**:
- Hunter's followers see it (instant audience)
- Credibility boost (someone vouches for you)
- Often higher ranking (PH algorithm favors hunted)

**How to find hunters**:
1. Twitter search: "Product Hunt hunter" + followers 1K+
2. Check recent launches (similar products)
3. Indie Hackers community members

**DM Template**:
```
Hey [Name] 👋

I saw you hunted [Product] on Product Hunt — congrats on [specific metric, e.g., "top 5 of the day"]!

I'm launching Claude SaaS Starter on [Date] — the first Next.js boilerplate optimized for Claude Sonnet 4.5 (every competitor is OpenAI-first).

Would you be interested in hunting it? Happy to share a preview and answer any questions.

No worries if you're busy! Either way, thanks for building cool stuff publicly 🙏

[Your name]
[Link to Gumroad preview or GitHub]
```

**Send to**: 20-30 hunters
**Goal**: 5-10 confirmations
**Timing**: 5-7 days before launch

### Option 2: Self-Hunt (Backup)

If no hunter confirms, self-hunt is fine.

**PH allows it** (officially)
**Just less reach** (no hunter's followers)

**How**: "Submit" button on PH → Fill same form

Excited to share: Claude SaaS Starter just launched on Product Hunt! 🚀

After analyzing the boilerplate market, I found a gap: every starter kit is OpenAI-first. Claude Sonnet 4.5 has superior streaming and tool use, but zero dedicated tooling.

So I built the first Claude-optimized Next.js boilerplate.

What's included:
✅ Complete authentication (email + OAuth)
✅ Real-time Claude streaming (<200ms)
✅ Stripe subscription management
✅ Admin dashboard with analytics
✅ 300+ pages of documentation

Launch offer: $119 (20% off, limited to first 50)

Check it out on Product Hunt: [link]

Your feedback would be invaluable 🙏

### Reddit (Priority #4 - Careful)

**Subreddits** (post AFTER getting traction on PH):

- r/entrepreneur (if you focus on business angle)
- r/reactjs (if you focus on Next.js aspect)

**Template** (humble, not spammy):
```
Title: I built the first Claude-optimized SaaS boilerplate (feedback welcome)

Body:
Hey r/SideProject,

I just launched Claude SaaS Starter on Product Hunt after 2 weeks of building.

**The problem**: Every Next.js boilerplate is OpenAI-first. Claude Sonnet 4.5 has better streaming but no dedicated tooling.

**My solution**: First boilerplate optimized for Claude (auth + streaming + billing + admin + docs).

**What I learned**:
- Documentation quality matters more than features
- Mid-tier pricing ($149) is underserved
- Building in public = built-in accountability

**Launching on PH today**: [link]

Would love your feedback (both positive and critical)! What would make you actually buy a boilerplate?

Tech stack: Next.js 14, Supabase, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Stripe, Tailwind
```

**Timing**: 2-3 hours after PH launch (once you have some upvotes/comments)

**Rule**: Add value, not just promo

## Troubleshooting

### "Not getting upvotes"

**Diagnose**:
- Are you engaging? (reply to every comment)
- Did you promote? (Twitter, DMs, email)
- Is launch time optimal? (12:01am PST)

**Fix**:
- Double-down on engagement (more replies)
- Ask supporters directly (DM: "Would you upvote?")
- Post in communities (Indie Hackers, Reddit)

### "Getting upvotes but no sales"

**Diagnose**:
- Is pricing clear? (on Gumroad page)
- Is value proposition clear? (what problem it solves)
- Are screenshots compelling? (show actual product)

**Fix**:
- Add "Early bird ending soon" urgency
- Improve Gumroad description (clearer benefits)
- Add testimonials (if you have any)

### "Getting criticism in comments"

**Diagnose**:
- Is it constructive? (valid feedback)
- Is it trolling? (ignore)

**Fix**:
- Thank them (publicly)
- Explain your decision (rationale)
- If valid: "Great point, I'll add this to roadmap"
- Never argue or get defensive

## Templates: PH Comment Replies

**Question about pricing**:
```
Great question! I wrestled with this.

My logic: 40h × $100/h = $4K value. $149 = 96% discount.

But I'm curious: what price would feel right to you? Always open to feedback 🙏
```

**Feature request**:
```
Love this idea! 🔥

Not in v1 but definitely on the roadmap. Would you use it if it had [feature]?

Trying to prioritize based on what customers actually need vs what I think they need.
```

**Comparison to competitor**:
```
Fair comparison! [Competitor] is great.

Key differences:
- [Competitor]: [their strength]
- Claude SaaS Starter: [your strength]

Different use cases. Both valid 👍
```

**Congrats / support**:
```
Thank you! 🙏 Means a lot.

Following your work too - [specific compliment if you know them].

Let me know if you ever launch on PH, happy to return the support!
```

**Criticism / negative**:
```
Appreciate the honest feedback 🙏

You're right about [acknowledge valid point]. I [explain decision or admit oversight].

If you have specific suggestions, I'm all ears. Trying to build what people actually need.
```
