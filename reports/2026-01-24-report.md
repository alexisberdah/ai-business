## 🚨 Blockers & Risks

### Critical Issues (Production-Blocking)

**None Currently** ✅

All Week 2 development tasks are clear, well-defined, and unblocked.

---

### High Priority (Not Blocking, But Important)

**1. Week 2 Development Timeline** ⏳
- **Impact**: Marketing campaign can't start until product 100% ready
- **Effort**: 14-17 hours estimated (spread over 5-7 days)
- **Risk**: Delay Week 2 = delay entire marketing timeline (60-day campaign)
- **Mitigation**: Front-load Week 2 work (Mon-Wed focus), complete by Jan 31

**2. First-Time Product Hunt Launch** ⚠️
- **Impact**: No prior PH launch experience (learning curve)
- **Risk**: Suboptimal execution could reduce ranking (target: Top 10)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Complete PH template ready (`templates/product-hunt.md`)
  - Pre-recruit 10 hunters (Day 12-13)
  - Practice launch day timeline via checklist
  - Study successful PH launches in advance

---

### Technical Risks

**Risk 1: Stripe Integration Complexity** (Probability: Low, Impact: Medium)
- **Description**: Subscription webhooks + usage-based billing can be tricky
- **Mitigation**:
  - Use Stripe official Next.js template as reference
  - Allocate 4h (not 3h) for integration
  - Test thoroughly in Stripe test mode before production

**Risk 2: Marketing Burnout** (Probability: Medium, Impact: High)
- **Description**: 60-day campaign requires sustained daily effort (ADHD risk)
- **Mitigation**:
  - Batching strategy (Sunday 1.5h writes entire week)
  - Templates eliminate blank page paralysis
  - Sustainable 30-60 min/day (not 2-3h daily)
  - Weekly reviews enable pivots if overwhelmed

**Risk 3: Zero Sales Scenario** (Probability: 20%, Impact: Critical)
- **Description**: What if marketing executes well but 0 sales by Week 3?
- **Mitigation**:
  - Pivot triggers defined in marketing plan
  - Adaptive budget strategy ($100 initial → scale if works)
  - Multiple channels (not all-in on one)
  - Worst case: Portfolio piece + learnings for Boilerplate #2

---

## 📅 Next Steps

### Immediate (Week 2 - Jan 25-31)

**Priority 1**: Stripe Subscription Billing (3-4h)

  - Stripe account setup + API keys
  - Checkout session integration
  - Webhook handlers (subscription created, updated, cancelled)
  - Customer portal (manage subscription)
  - Test mode validation
- **Blocker**: None
- **Owner**: Daewon + Claude

**Priority 2**: Admin Dashboard (3-4h)

  - Overage prevention
  - Dashboard display
- **Blocker**: None
- **Owner**: Daewon + Claude

**Priority 4**: OAuth Providers (2h)

  - GitHub OAuth via Supabase
  - Update signup/login UI
  - Test both flows
- **Blocker**: None
- **Owner**: Daewon + Claude

**Priority 5**: Launch Assets (2-3h)
- **Why**: Required before Pre-Launch campaign
- **Tasks**:
  - Gumroad landing page (copy from templates)
  - Product Hunt listing draft
  - Demo GIF/video (Loom 2-3 min)
  - Screenshots (5-7 key screens)

## 🤔 Questions for Project Manager

### Decision Needed

**Question 1: Week 2 Development Focus - Speed vs Polish?**

**Context**: Week 2 has 14-17h of development remaining. Options for approach:

**Options**:

- **Option A: Speed Priority** (Ship by Jan 29)
  - **Approach**: Focus core features only (Stripe, Admin, Usage Metering), skip OAuth, minimal polish
  - **Pros**: Start marketing 2 days earlier, momentum maintained
  - **Cons**: Missing OAuth (lower conversion), less polished UX
  - **Timeline**: 3 days of focused work (Mon-Wed)

- **Option B: Complete Priority** (Ship by Jan 31)
  - **Approach**: All planned features (Stripe, Admin, Usage, OAuth, Polish)
  - **Pros**: Higher quality product, better first impressions, OAuth improves conversion
  - **Cons**: 2 extra days before marketing starts
  - **Timeline**: 5 days spread work (Mon-Fri)

**Recommendation**: **Option B** (Complete Priority)

**Reasoning**:
1. First impressions matter (Product Hunt launch is one-shot)
2. OAuth significantly improves signup conversion (industry standard)
3. 2 days difference negligible in 60-day campaign
4. Quality > speed for premium product ($149 price point)

**Impact**: Option B delays Pre-Launch start from Feb 1 → Feb 3, but increases Product Hunt success probability

---

**Question 2: Marketing Budget - Start Conservative or Commit Full?**

**Context**: Marketing plan proposes $200-320 budget (PH promo, Twitter Ads, Reddit Ads, Buffer). Alternatively, could start with $0 organic-only.

**Options**:

- **Option A: Start $0 Organic** (Test First)
  - **Budget**: $0 initial
  - **Strategy**: Pure organic build-in-public, see Week 1 results, add paid if underperforming
  - **Pros**: Zero financial risk, validates organic viability
  - **Cons**: Lower Product Hunt rank probable (#15-25 vs #5-10), lower reach
  - **Success Probability**: 65-70% (10+ sales)

- **Option B: Start $100 Selective** (Adaptive)
  - **Budget**: $100 (PH promo $50-100 only)
  - **Strategy**: Boost Product Hunt launch day only, wait on other paid
  - **Pros**: Balanced risk, improves PH rank, preserves budget for pivots
  - **Cons**: Missing Twitter Ads opportunity
  - **Success Probability**: 75-80% (10+ sales)

- **Option C: Commit $200-320 Full** (As Planned)
  - **Budget**: $200-320 (PH + Twitter + Reddit + Buffer)
  - **Strategy**: Execute full paid strategy from Day 1
  - **Pros**: Maximum success probability, full plan execution
  - **Cons**: Higher upfront cost, risk if organic would have worked
  - **Success Probability**: 80-85% (10+ sales)

**Recommendation**: **Option B** (Start $100 Selective)

**Reasoning**:
1. Product Hunt launch is highest-leverage moment (worth $50-100 boost)
2. Preserve $100-220 for adaptive response (if organic underperforms Week 1)
3. Twitter Ads effectiveness unknown (your audience size zero initially)
4. Can always scale up; can't scale down after spending

**Impact**: Option B = Balanced risk/reward, $100 upfront, $100-220 reserve for pivots

---

### Clarifications Needed

- [ ] **Twitter Premium** ($8/month) - Worth it for long threads + analytics, or use free tier?
- [ ] **Buffer vs Hypefury** ($15 vs $19/month) - Preference for scheduling tool?
- [ ] **Early Bird Pricing** - Confirm $99 for first 10 buyers (vs $149 regular)?

### Resource Needs

- [ ] **Stripe Account** - Setup required for Week 2 development
- [ ] **Gumroad Account** - Create if doesn't exist (free)
- [ ] **Product Hunt Account** - Warmup starting Day 3 (comment 5 products/day)
